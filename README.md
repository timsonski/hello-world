# hello-world
My first repository in GitHub

Originally from Manchester, England, but lived in Sydney Australia for the past 11 years
Work in finance and am setting up my own Asset Management company to invest in shares around the world
I think automation and coding can play a huge role in automating some of the tasks we face on a daily basis
I've completed a Data Analysis Course on Codecademy and really want to get more experience at analysing data.
This was done on Python using matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy etc
I also have a few idea for cool ipad apps, if anyone is interested helping?
